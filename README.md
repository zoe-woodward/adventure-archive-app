# Adventure Archive
## An app for recording and sharing travel memories

By signing up to this app, users can record details of trips they've been on and can view what others have written in order to find inspiration for their next holiday! 

When travelling we want to travel light; heaps of paper, notebooks and stationary are no longer a convenient way of recording our journeys. With the app; users can update entries as often as they wish, to make sure nothing is forgotten.

Sometimes deciding where to go next is the hardest part of arranging a trip; so hopefully reading others' first-hand accounts can help inspire users looking for their future holiday destinations.

Personally I love travelling and over the years have accumulated countless notepads purchased at airports with disjointed diary entries from trips away. Having all of my memories in one place would be a lot more useful! And there's so many parts of the world to see - being able to read about other people's travels would definitely help me to add some new places to my travel bucket list!
